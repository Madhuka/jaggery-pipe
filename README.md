jaggery-pipe
============

Jaggery-Pipe is a connect like middleware stack for the Jaggery Framework.It is HEAVILY inspired by the way connect does things.

Installation
============
Drop the jaggery-pipe module into the PRODUCT_HOME/modules/ directory to get started working with the Pipe.The plug-ins folder has a 
few other modules that you might find interesting.

The Jaggery-Pipe can be used as a simple routing mechanism but its real power comes from plug-ins (think of it plug-ins as middleware).

Plug-ins
========
Plug-ins can come in two flavours;
1. Jaggery modules
2. Plain old JS files
